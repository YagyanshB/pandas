# Pandas

Pandas is one of the most potent and transformative libraries in Python. I will use this repository to carry out exploratory and investigative data analysis. I have undertaken guided **YouTube** videos to build the code, for which the links are attached below.

4. **Ultra Marathon Analysis**

   This Data Analytics portfolio project showcases your Python prowess and impresses recruiters with your Data Cleaning and insight-driven visualisations. I carried out this project with the help of a YouTube channel, the link to which is attached below.
