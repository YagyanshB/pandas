# Zero To Pandas

This is a six-part Lecture Series from the acclaimed and resourceful YouTube Channel FreeCodeCamp Org. The series aims to solidify the foundations of data analysis using Python, specifically focusing on the Pandas Library. 

To use the repository, please follow the below set of instructions:

1. You can use your own **IDE** or leverage **Google Colab**, which I have done in this case. I prefer **Colab** owing to its accessibility and user-friendly nature
2. Please use the lecture series by clicking on the attached link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsDFiZPljYo&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblvI1i46ScbKV2jH1gdL7VQ&index=1 which will take you to Part 1
3. All **Assignment Solutions** have been uploaded as well in the repository; however, I would strongly recommend not looking at them until you have created your independent solutions

**Happy Coding** and if there are aspects of my code or documentation that could be improved, please don't hesitate to comment or reach out to me.
